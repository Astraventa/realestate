# 🔓 Make Google Sheet Publicly Viewable

## 🎯 Problem
When clicking "View Sheet" button, it shows "Request sent - You'll get an email letting you know if your request was approved"

## ✅ Solution: Make Sheet Public

### **Step 1: Open Your Google Sheet**
1. Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HXMfl-pTI8NXhw6Ev3w3d2lBYHZRbCWwNs7WJM8mak/edit
2. Make sure you're logged in as the owner

### **Step 2: Change Sharing Settings**
1. Click the **green "Share" button** (top right)
2. In the sharing dialog, click **"Change to anyone with the link"**
3. Select **"Viewer"** (not Editor - for security)
4. Click **"Done"**

### **Step 3: Verify**
1. Copy the link
2. Open in incognito/private window
3. Should open without asking for permission

### **Step 4: Update Link Format (Optional)**
If you want to use the public view link format:
- Current: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HXMfl-pTI8NXhw6Ev3w3d2lBYHZRbCWwNs7WJM8mak/edit`
- Public view: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HXMfl-pTI8NXhw6Ev3w3d2lBYHZRbCWwNs7WJM8mak/edit?usp=sharing`

Both work, but the `/edit?usp=sharing` format is clearer for public access.

## 🔒 Security Note

**Making it public means:**
- ✅ Anyone with the link can VIEW the sheet
- ✅ They CANNOT edit (if you set to Viewer)
- ✅ They CANNOT see who else has access
- ✅ Perfect for lead viewing

**This is safe because:**
- Only viewing, not editing
- No sensitive data (just leads)
- Better than requesting permission every time

## ✅ After Setup

Once public, the "View Sheet" button will work for everyone without asking for permission!
