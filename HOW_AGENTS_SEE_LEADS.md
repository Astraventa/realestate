# 👨‍💼 How Real Estate Agents See Leads

## 🎯 Current Setup (What Works Now)

### **How Agents See Leads:**

1. **Agent gets Google Sheet URL**
   - You share the sheet link with them
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HXMfl-pTI8NXhw6Ev3w3d2lBYHZRbCWwNs7WJM8mak/edit`

2. **Agent opens the sheet**
   - Can bookmark it
   - Can access from phone/computer
   - Can check anytime

3. **Agent sees new leads**
   - New row appears automatically
   - All information is there
   - Timestamp shows when lead came in

### **Current Workflow:**
```
Client submits → Saved to sheet → Agent checks sheet → Agent contacts client
```

**Problem:** Agent has to manually check the sheet (no automatic notification)
